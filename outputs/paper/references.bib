@article{Shafer,
	abstract = {Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic created rapid, wide-ranging, and significant disruptions to work and family life. Accordingly, these dramatic changes may have reshaped parents' gendered division of labor in the short term. Using data from 1,234 Canadian parents in different-sex relationships, we compare retrospective reports of perceived sharing in how housework and childcare tasks were split prior to the declaration of the pandemic to assessments of equality afterward. Further, we describe perceptions of changes in fathers' engagement in these tasks overall, by respondent gender, and by employment arrangements before and during the pandemic. Results indicate small shifts toward a more equal division of labor in the early ``lockdown'' months, with increased participation in housework and childcare by fathers, supporting the needs exposure hypothesis. We conclude by discussing gender differences in parents' reports and potential implications for longer term gender equality.},

@article{Christopher,
	abstract = { Social scientists have provided rich descriptions of the ascendant cultural ideologies surrounding motherhood and paid work. In this article, I use in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of 40 employed mothers to explore how they navigate the ``intensive mother'' and ``ideal worker'' ideologies and construct their own accounts of good mothering. Married mothers in this sample construct scripts of ``extensive mothering,'' in which they delegate substantial amounts of the day-to-day child care to others, and reframe good mothering as being ``in charge'' of and ultimately responsible for their children's well-being. Single mothers describe extensive mothering in different ways, and their narratives suggest less accountability to the ``intensive mothering'' model. Mothers in this sample also justify employment in novel ways: They emphasize the benefits of employment for themselves---not only their children---and they reject the long work hours imposed by an ideal worker model. The article ends with the implications of extensive mothering for the motherhood and employment literatures and for gender equality. },
